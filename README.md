# WhereDidMyCashGo
The purpose of this app is to track and display spending for the current calendar month. Ideally, it is used to track
discretionary spending (i.e., clothes shopping, Happy Hour, Sunday brunch) in situations where one uses cash
or a debit card.

The user enters a new transaction in the Purchase (Macy's, Subway, Dry Cleaning, etc.) and Cost fields. Upon tapping
the Save button, the total for the current month is updated, and the transaction is saved.

At any time, the user can view a table list of all the transactions entered for the current month.

When the app is launched in a new month, This Month's Total value gets moved to Last Month's Total value,
This Month's Total gets reset to zero, and the list of monthly transactions is deleted, all in preparation
for the new month. The purpose of saving and displaying Last Month's Total is to compare the current month to the 
previous month.
